I have used react hooks like useState for managing states and ContextAPI for storing data.
I have used useContex hook for accessing data from ContextAPI in order to use in particular Components.
I have installed uuid library from that i imported v4 inorder to generate inique id for each item .
I have also installed react-icons from that i imported FaEdit and  FaRegTrashAlt icons for editing icon and deleting icon in my project.
I have also used props to send data from parent component to child component in some cases where i required.
I have also used conditional rendering concept in cases of items not added to lis and items added to the list
